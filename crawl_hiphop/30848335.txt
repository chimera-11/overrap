We just landed in Korea back 
from Tokyo in it we got to get it 
But gotta make sure it's documented 
But before the documentarians 
document it 
We gotta polish off 
the Glock a tidbit
Don't forget the way we came up 
never once was a pup 
We was rhymin off the cuff kin 
ones like you up
So it's a never a thing for us 
to go back to that 
Turn our hats to the side hit ya 
boo from the back 
Don’t snap for you kers 
less you paying a stack 
to get buried 
on your own sit flat on your back
We straight aiming where the gold 
is this is the plan figure the laws 
aint changed not now not never
I was not a little kid on the block 
but more the little pit on the block 
that bit his way to the top 
do not forget it
This insane its insane 
that's I'm not committed 
Oh the rhymes isn't why You visited 
Trying to dine with some wine 
hear some gossip is it
How this for this for gossip
There's kids hating on the block
And it's strange 
cuz it's the block I invented
You know me and moss ain't start 
as artists more as heart harvesters 
for wanna be artists honest 
Turned all y'all ghost and 
when you came back to life 
all of a sudden we are the targets 
Who exactly told you kers 
you could even try to think of 
counting us out
You would not be quick find 
another set of brothers 
that can do the sit we bout
Dirty Apron is the king squad 
Mind your manners 
when you talk to gods
Invitation only conversation 
best be careful not to wear 
your welcome off
Why they call my poyzen city 
Boy its cause we love to 
smoke the kimchi
Knew this girl that told me 
Durban poison good especially 
with a dash of pipi
Came to Seoul and 
made a lot of noise 
Motivation gotta feed a boy
Snatching purses 
from these lazy rappers
That’s when we tell em cookings 
just a metaphor like 안녕
Hopped of the plane we like 안녕
Hop out like 안녕
Hopped of the plane we like 안녕
Hopped of the plane we like 안녕
Hop out like 안녕
Hopped of the plane we like 안녕
한국사람처럼 먹는 남자 
찌개 보쌈 I love the 곱창 
Hop off the cab hey wait 
I'm coppin 배 말랑 말랑 
still kin flossin
50000 in my king wallet 
Prime example 
how we live like bosses 
I just landed and already 
have the king 
if South Korea in my king pocket
I just spent all my dough in Japan 
A Meal at McDonald's out 
there is a couple grand 
I'm lucky my 형 is my man 
he'll pay the 계산 again 
형 밥 사주세요 
This is the life that we live
k with the kids 
VMC we is the team
Out in Korea we giving em 
heat after heat
So salute when you see us 
and hop out like 안녕
Hopped of the plane we like 안녕
Hop out like 안녕
Hopped of the plane we like 안녕
Hopped of the plane we like 안녕
Hop out like 안녕
Hopped of the plane we like 안녕
