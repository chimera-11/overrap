sitting there in black and gold

좋은 차 많은 돈
없을 수 있어 하지만
난 널 아낄 수 있고
또 소중히 다룰 수 있어
그리고 네가 원하면
우주선을 타 밤하늘
건너 별을 따 너의
손에 쥐여줄 수 있어
말만 해 뭐든지 뭐 어때
비 오는 날 커피 okay
신사 홍대 압구 okay
아침에 no make up
it’s okay it’s okay
I’ll be getting it ready to fuse
sitting on top of the world
just cue
missing a puzzle I swear it’s you
you know I can paint the world
sitting there in black and gold
you’re the perfect chemical
I gotta test I gotta know
you know I’m no criminal
but I could take you heart and go
you’re the perfect chemical
I gotta test I gotta gotta
just let me
just let me
just let me
just let me
IF YOU LET ME BE THE CODE
네가 원하는 색깔별로
하늘도 바다도 산도
함께 칠할 수 있어
IF YOU LET ME BE THE CODE
우리의 많은 다른 점도
선으로 이어갈 수 있어
