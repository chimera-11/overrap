Pull out my mind before passed out 
Lookin other way you don't miss her 
I don't wanna make you think of her 
Pics out cut the rope 
Don't deserve hope no mo 
Don't need u callinh her no hoe 
I just don't let you fall in hole 
no more cut the rope 
She from a hole of the fire 
that you have been drown to 
She need more water 
so I can be free to fall into 
너는 내 손을 잡아서 
힘내서 일어나서 걸어가 
갈증이 니앞을 막으면 cut the rope 
비내린 후 하늘에 난 빛이 
감정을 mess up and down 
내맘을 흔들어놓지 
Fall in to the ground 
너가 날 볼때 바지 불편해 
그거 참 부끄럽네 
Pop up the bottle and be drunk 
to this sound yeah 
Cut the rope 
너와 나 사인 feels like a dope 
내겐 no one 
너는 내게 one and only purple girl 
purple girl purple girl 
내게 one and only purple girl 
purple girl purple girl 
내게 one and only purple girl 
너는 내게 크립토나잇 
I can't forget this tonite 
왜 내가 힘들게 자꾸만 널 찾을까
너는 내게 크립토나잇
I can't forget this tonite
왜 내가 힘들게 널 찾을까
