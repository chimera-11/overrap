Baby we're like on a boat
Come up and row in this wave
I See nothing like uh we 
Move and tell em out the lane
He cannot catch what we talk
She cannot find how we fuck
Couldn't see something like we
Perfection is way out of tip

We be dancing on a mat
You're like Bebop yeah
위에 나 올라타면 바뀌어 
이제 팝스타일
잠시 쉬고 움직여 
Vertigo 오를 때 정상
빠르고 가파르지
내 생각을 죽여줘
넌 나에 대해 모르는 게 없지
노 로맨스 알잖아 
내게 필요한 게 뭔지 넌
네 방식은 다른놈들 뒤통수를 쳐
밖에선 능숙한데 나한텐 늘 묻지
How can't I love you
친절하게도 아니고
서투르지도 않아
Whatever you do I go double set
However you do it's so perfect
특별한 건 하나도 없지만
특별하지 이건
넌 나에 대해 다 알고
난 너에 대해 알아
So what does it mean
다른 얘기는 귀에 안 담지
Just you and I
Like we don't give a umm
다른 얘기는 귀에 안 담지

야 just hit me up 
바뻐 in studio work 
but I be there by 여덟
딴 애들은 slaughter 
우리 둘이 blow up
숨 버텨
구름 건너편 
I've been 너무 벌어 
하룻밤에 지갑 털어
니모습을 더 close up
내려가 더 밑으로 
아무렇게나 I feel so 
이불 안에 널 들춰 
팔에 기대 더 멀리멀리 
내 목소리가 안 들리는곳
팔에 기대 더 멀리멀리 
내 목소리가 안 들리는곳 
딴 애들은 기대 못해 못해 
기대 못해 못해 못해 
걔넨 못 부려 my flex 
Baby 너가 나의 swag
Baby 너가 나의 swag
