already got the tickets 
you got it too 
But you'll get 
at another destination 
I already knew 
so It makes me anxious 
and you tryna crucify me 
In the meantime 
and I ain't got nothing to choose 
I always be true 
but 안일했고 난 안일했고 
아니겠지 아니게끔 
잘해야 했지만 
남이 됐고 넌 남이 됐고 
have made countless mistakes 
and now I am missing you 
If I could see you again 
If I could see you again 
I would do something 
I gotta do something 
I gotta do something 
Oh no 
How could you forgive me 
Oh no 
I can't just let it be 
You gotta leave me anyway 
and I know it 
It's gonna happen soon 
You gotta leave me anyway 
and I know it 
It's gonna happen soon 
I'm gonna take a trip 
without you 
gonna see your pic 
and Imma act like zorg 
You make me feel blue 
and sometimes make me happy 
I love you 
though you are flighty 
So I've been calling you Betty 
시간은 비싸니까 
우린 바다를 보러 가 
우린 술에 젖어 방의 불을 끌 때 
눈 앞에 자연을 넌 거부해 
난 시간을 다시 loop해 
이슬 맺힌 땅에 별이 뜰 때 
풀린 눈에 담을 세상에서 
남은 대화를 해 
We are gonna grow up 
and we can get another love 
We can get another love 
We can get another love 
when we be in other worlds 
난 비행기를 타야 돼 
우린 축소된 모습의 지구를 봐야 돼 
나무에 풀이 하얄 때 우린 봐야 돼 
Oh no 
How could you forgive me 
Oh no 
I can't just let it be 
You gotta leave me anyway 
and I know it 
It's gonna happen soon 
You gotta leave me anyway
and I know it
It's gonna happen soon
