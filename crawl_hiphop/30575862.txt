Sometimes you saying i'm boring
I'm hoping not
Sometimes you give me hurt
I'm hoping not
But i just wanna you fall into me
Someday you go away from me 
I'm hoping not
Somebody saying your bad guy 
I'm hoping not
But i just wanna you fall into me
I can't breath if you leave
Always i found your lips
Love is like a drugaddiction
Broken Strumble
Everyone has imperfection
My love
My heart
My soul
I think
I hope
You stay 
everything is broken
Love is like a drugaddiction
Broken Strumble
Everyone has imperfection
Sometimes you saying i'm boring
I'm hoping not
Sometimes you give me hurt
I'm hoping not
But i just wanna you fall into me
like black hole
like black hole
Sometimes you saying i'm boring
I'm hoping not
Sometimes you give me hurt
I'm hoping not
But i just wanna you fall into me
Someday you go away from me 
I'm hoping not
Somebody saying your bad guy 
I'm hoping not
But i just wanna you fall into me
like black hole black hole
