I know you're about to say 
the exact same words 
that you always like to spit 
right in front of my face 
again yah 
I know you're about to say those 
stuff that I can't take anymore 
that you used to say 
just to kill your pain yah 
she told me everything's gon be 
okay yay okay yay 
maybe everything is 
but I know I'm never gon be 
fxxking okay yay okay yay 
자몽색 pills got me way far 
popped 'em while I'm high 
on some hay yah 
긴 생 머리 hoe got nothing 
more to say yah 
얼굴색은 fuxxing pale 
like some geisha 
we don't talk much 
cause we hate each other 
but we don't fight 
cause we fxxkin same yah 
손바닥 위엔 자몽색 태양 
손바닥 위엔 자몽색 태양 
we just don't say 
any prayers no more 
cause we've done it 
too many times before aye 
finally we've met the man 
at the station 
and he said he's the man of god 
later we've watched him drown 
under the god's shade yah 
wasted our whole life 
in the backyard 
we just need more pills 
than cares now 
yellow face turning red 
I see that's chaos 
we forgave each other 
cause we've got no god now 
소주병 아홉개 that's a shame yeah 
if I gotta take it alone 
she gon be crying now 
world and dreams slowly fade 
in then fade out 
if I leave this bitch alone 
tomorrow that'll be crime 
I said 기억은 과장되고 
빨리 타니까 좋게 잊어 날 
미래에도 옆을 지킬게 
even if I'm fxxkin stranger now 
know it sounds insane 
but I know I've gotta stay high 
맨정신에 자살하면 어떨지 잘 아니까 
좋은 말은 아껴둬 하나도 
안 괜찮을 거 다 아니까 
딱 내 문제들 만큼만 삼키고 
눈 감으면 시절은 
빨리 또 지나쳐가 
promise you I won't be late 
again and take you 
far away on time 
cause 맨정신에 자살하면 
어떨지 잘 아니까
