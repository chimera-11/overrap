We unravel rap niggas 
don't play with the gifted 
Beyond legend dawg 
I'm Johnathan lifted 
Y'all niggas bitches 
y'all niggas hoes 
but we dug for the vision 
And all I see is dead people 
this a prophet's fruition 
All I see is dead people 
I need a profit for wishing 
Crazy we needed 
them dead people to stay 
alive in this system 
But got damn Uncle Sam 
where was you 
when we was all UpEast 
Mobbing up and down that hill 
looking for something to eat 
Caught in my doom 
ready to die like biggie sent me 
I'm a different kind of hustler 
I need nickles and the pennies 
I need plenty mane 
I ain't the daddy 
I'm a different mane 
bloodline deep 
look in yo face can tell yo 
daddy was a sissy mane 
PAT in the cut 
holding the wall up 
like it owe him something 
Homie we know you fronting 
Lyn mean-mugging like 
he seen something 
y'all niggas ain't seen nothing 
We got a A1 vision at stake 
Y'all niggas wanna be 
great or y'all niggas 
want a spot on the plate 
Big dick skinny 
but fuck like a heavyweight 
Not physically but mentally 
no need for the blind date 
Her cerebral's a cathedral 
confession beyond great so 
We gon get it when it's time right 
We gon get it when it's time right 
I know my niggas tired of waiting 
We gon get it when it's time right 
We gon get it when it's time 
babies crying 
no more time for the patience 
We gon get it when it's time right 
We gon get it when it's time right 
I know my niggas tired of waiting 
We gon get it when it's time right 
We gon get it when it's time 
Divine climate the coldest 
divine conscious 
My settled with divine options 
I'm trying to ball 
before the time stoppage 
I let it go from half-court 
before I let a dork 
define these divine pockets 
Give'em game or take the pain away 
getting this money 
It feels good to take 
the shame away 
get a check and spend it 
on my lady mane 
When I was down she never let me 
hit the pavement mane 
I never needed love 
just somebody to listen to 
Started rapping cause the culture 
shit was pitiful 
Now I'm hella gifted getting lifted 
super ceiling cool 
Fans held me down when I was hot 
down pitiful 
Dawg I kick it literal 
Literally we living in hell 
piss on the fire 
Demons will never 
burn this nigga's desire 
We done came a long way 
you couldn't walk inside a nigga shoes 
Take from all this running 
only thing a real niggas lose 
We gon get it when it's time right 
We gon get it when it's time right 
I know my niggas tired of waiting 
We gon get it when it's time right 
We gon get it when it's time 
babies crying

We gon get it when it's time right 
We gon get it when it's time right 
I know my niggas tired of waiting 
We gon get it when it's time right 
We gon get it when it's time 
I spread love and paint pictures 
that ain't made for the TV 
This shit butter dawg you

I can make it look easy 
rather than hard 
them country boys in the yard 
I know I'm destine to shine 
my scares come from the stars 
We bang harder than y'all

Put it on let'em play 
One Time got granny dancing

Feeling like I'm one with the times 
I follow the signs 
below and behind yeah
