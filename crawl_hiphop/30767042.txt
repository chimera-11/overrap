No matter what i do
No matter what u do
Just keep it in your mind
I just cant let u go
My heart is chained with ur soul
Save me with your love
I will always be on your side
I feel what you feel
dont have to tell me no no
I see what you see
dont have to say no no no
I falling down down
down down down girl
Faliing down down
down down down girl
I go wherever u go
like a we are the one
I never felt the same
eventhough I been there done it
There were empty spot before u
poped up mah life I meant it
Where ever ever I go
Whatever ever I do
I wanna be with you erday
매일이 파티야 샴페인
어디든 나타날테니 언제든지
전화해 난 너의 소울메이트
I linked to you
I meant to you
Theres things are never change
모든게 변해도
You and I forever ever
You and I forever
We are never gonna change
Don't worry nothing at all
My girl take my hand
I show u the way
I feel what you feel
dont have to tell me no no
I see what you see
dont have to say no no no
I falling down down
down down down girl
Faliing down down
down down down girl
I go wherever u go
like a we are the one
