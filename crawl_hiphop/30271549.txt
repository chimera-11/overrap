Daisy at the very first
moment I saw you
just couldn't breathe
felt like my heart getting squeezed
guess we were simply
meant to be together
other than that
어떻게 설명이 안 돼
Daisy ever since you
knocked on my 마음의 문
my life has changed
envisioned you in my 매일 밤 꿈
though memories fade
would I ever forget
but Daisy
why you so hazy now
it ain't you
ain't the Daisy who I love
still even the darkest part of you
amazes me
this is crazy baby
love thee love thee
hope you don't fall
any deeper though
I have my own limits
just hold my hand sweety
내가 다 해결해 줄 테니
알지 우리 함께 할 거라는 거
이 생에서도 and the next one too
the day of my death would
be the day after yours
Ima break all the obstacles
between 나와 너
fancy this fancy that
just tell me what you want
staying next to me
now and ever yeah
that's all I want
I'm careful what I wish for
you gotta know that girl
when this rain stops
너라는 꽃이 필까
Daisy I lost her in the haze crazy
baby 너를 볼 때 난 또 어땠는지
Daisy we fallin' in the haze crazy
baby 나를 볼 때 넌 또 어땠는지 
Daisy my love 그거 알아
너를 만나기 위해서라면 나
은하수를 건너고
across the big dipper
네가 있는 그 하얀 집으로 갈 거야
but 지금의 나 just can‘t stand it
this sick gap
between my dream and reality
어디에 있을까 넌
이 안개를 걷어내면
상념의 밭을 둘러싼
울타리를 넘어가면
probably beyond that
Norwegian wood
달이 뜰 때면
waiting for me to find you
chill down
Daisy no need to rush
이 밤이 널
다시 데려갈까 두려워 so hush
겁내지마 wherever you at girl
I’m your guardian
past present and future
you be my ship
Ima be your lighthouse
you be my Hailey
Ima be your shady
Daisy I lost her in the haze crazy
baby 너를 볼 때 난 또 어땠는지
Daisy we fallin' in the haze crazy
baby 나를 볼 때 넌 또 어땠는지 
Daisy I hate to say this
but you making me sick
look what you've done to me
after all these hustle and struggle
I ain't got nothing left
now what Daisy now what
I cried I tried
fuck I’m about to die out
Daisy seriously
is this what you wanted it to be
tearing me
into pieces and
throwing me into an abyss
now that everything is in vain
I can still
tell you one thing for sure
from the bottom of my heart
it was all yours
from the beginning to the end
my love has never been untrue
Ima see you at the next life to come
swear to god
Ima make it come true
wish I could turn back the time
back to the time
when you were my sheer charm
rest in peace
Daisy my sweet little bae
if only if only
I could give everything
what I've got
그렇게 해서라도
널 가질 수만 있다면
for eternity I mean
you know Ima go for it
no doubt no doubt
to infinity and beyond
may my love be with you
when there's a start
there's an end for sure
with all my heart
I pray hereby
rest in peace
