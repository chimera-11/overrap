I can do it all for you
if you want me to ya
Just don't make me frown
Just don't make me frown
I can do it all for you
if you want me to ya
Just don't make me frown
Just don't make me frown
I go dumb for you
I go numb for you
Stack this cash
then I let it all burn for you
I can do it all for you
if you want me to yeah
I got some cash I'm counting bands
Two crosses printed on my pants
Foreign swerving through the lanes
Blowing smoke
and I'm lost in the maze
And your my maze
Yea I'm amazed
Girl you're insane
Oh I'm amazed
At you
I can do it all for you
if you want me to ya
Just don't make me frown
Just don't make me frown
I can do it all for you
if you want me to ya
Just don't make me frown
Just don't make me frown
I go dumb for you
I go numb for you
Stack this cash
then I let it all burn for you
I can do it all for you
if you want me to yeah
왜 또 그러는건데
오늘은 뭐가 문젠데
나같은 사람과 평생을 한다고 한게
누군데 또 왜그래
But why you tripping all like that
I really do not understand
This Forty got me going hazy man
I don't think I can comprehend
But baby listen
Uh you need to listen
You'll find no other
No one better
Than me
I can do it all for you
if you want me to ya
Just don't make me frown
Just don't make me frown
I can do it all for you
if you want me to ya
Just don't make me frown
Just don't make me frown
I go dumb for you
I go numb for you
Stack this cash
then I let it all burn for you
I can do it all for you
if you want me to yeah
