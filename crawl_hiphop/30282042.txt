People said I look good with yellow 
Some color like yellows 
feel soft and warm 
It looks soft but getting stiff 
But I don't want yours 
I want something new 
I'm going to choose 
blah blah 쉿 
Tictoc clock tic toc 
I don't wanna waste my time 
Sweet like a sugar yeah 
and sticky like a chocolate 
so I want to eat them all 
Wait What did you call 'em
