Woke up this morning
and if feel like
Everything gon' be alright
Feelin’ like don’t nobody own us
Even though i got the world
on my shoulders
My reality my reality
Never let my dreams be a casualty
I'm Living like i'm hanging off
the balcony
I learned how to make
my fears mad at me
And you know i ain't scared
of nothing
Not a care in sight
think I found the easy button
I'm gain it all
and i wouldn't trade for nothing
Just the tales of the life of the
rich and forever young is
Cause we live like dope bag
so hold on we might crash
I know they say that we dumb
but we be forever
be forever young
We stay out too late
and they do any migrate
and we got too much time
and we gone live forever young
be forever young Forever young
When you look at me
tell me what you see
Am I young man or a dumb man
who cares what you think
We just living
like tomorrow isn't promised
Everyday we got these haters
so astonished
Young and reckless
they say we wild without a cause
And we disrespectful
cuz we ain't riding with your laws
They say the good die young well
I’m live forever
See me covered by the sun
so my future brighter than ever
And we got a whole life to live
So we ain’t worried
'bout what time it is
I want it all you know
I ain't leaving nothing
Just the tales
from the life of the
rich and forever young is
Cause we live like dope bag
so hold on
we might crash
I know they say that we dumb
but we be forever
be forever young
We stay out too late
and they do any migrate
and we got too much time
and we gone live forever
be forever young
We live life
like there's no tomorrow
Everything ours no time to borrow
Can’t go back one thing
that I know
We’re just living
like we're young
We’re just living
like we're young
We’re just living
like we're young
We’re just living
like we're young
Cause we live like dope bag
so hold on we might crash
I know they say that we dumb
but we be forever
be forever young
We stay out too late
and they do any migrate
and we got too much time
and we gone live forever
be forever young
