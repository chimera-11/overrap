Me without u me without u
Me without u me without u
Me without u
Tears dropping
I'm walking walking
Keep on walking
Me without u
Tears dropping
I'm falling falling
Keep on falling
For you I put my girls down
I put my family down
I put my friends
but you don't see it
and then you go
around my own friends
you wanna hang around em
You just don't care about me
why did you say that you cared
You said that you loved me
but I don't notice your word here
I thought it was real love
I was a real man but you're so wack
I think about you I skip a beat
My heart stops when
I think about you
For you I did so many things
That i never did for her
Don't you ever feel
that you're irreplaceable
Don't you ever feel
that you're irreplaceable
Me without u
Tears dropping
I'm walking walking
Keep on walking
Me without u
Tears dropping
I'm falling falling
Keep on falling
The best that I wanted for you
was the best of me
I want to live
presidential like embassies
You made it so hard now better free
I was a solution a remedy
And for your career I had empathy
And even in that you discouraged me
never gave up on you respectably
Cause I have a vision dependency
I did anything just to see you smile
I told you don't listen to politics
I wanted to be there for you
every moment the negative
turn into positive
But you had to appreciate it
I'm fed up of always debating
Did you ever have a
real man in your life
I don't spend my time investigating
Don't you ever feel
that you're irreplaceable
Don't you ever feel
that you're irreplaceable
Me without u
Tears dropping
I'm walking walking
Keep on walking
Me without u
Tears dropping
I'm falling falling
Keep on falling
Me without u
Tears dropping
I'm walking walking
Keep on walking
Me without u
Tears dropping
I'm falling falling
Keep on falling
