if heaven is real 
it must be by the seaside 
ride on a dirt bike 
dive into an ocean 
everything with you  
go for a late night 
drive and get some pizza 
then stay in a parking lot 
we gotta get sober

내 친구들 전부 must be there 
if heaven is real 
거긴 바닷바람 늘 부는 데야 
this city vibe is freaky cold 
what's your plan for summer 
9 to 5 o fuck that 
im on the plane man im on it 
집 가는 길에 산 로또처럼 
뭔가를 믿어 뭐가 됐던 
그게 신이 됐든 돈이 됐든 
재미를 봤다면 그걸로 장땡 
ok 내 특급열차는  
on its way to heaven 
if heaven is real 
if heaven is real 
you 
and you 
you 
and you 
you 
and you

sober
미세먼지도 can't stop me
every moment be like sabi
city boy let's hit road
hitch and hike hop on the truck
부릉 통기타 툭 튕기면서 가자고
지평선 넘었을 때 저기 바다
it's the hella view
