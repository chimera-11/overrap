Lookin' to the past
when I was young
Thinkin' 'bout the memories
I've come to love
Feelin' like a grape turned into wine
and it will be okay
just give it time
give it time
Back in the days
on the boulevards of dreams
I used to kick rocks
in my Dada Supremes
It was Ecko Sean John
a pair of G Unit’s
I kicks the made styles
so you know I had to do it
Rocking with my Timbo’s had
the white tee to match
Man I didn’t dance
I just pulled up my pants
to lean back lean back
I leaned back lean back
I hit the roc away
I got my Roc A Wear
I wanted 8 gold chains
with my outerwear shabba
I wanted to floss
with my wrists
So I went to Target
got a G Shock in a jiff
I got kimchi stains
and I’m pissed
Thankfully there’s more
maybe 5 maybe 6
All thanks to Champs Sports
a thank you to FootLocker
You laced me up
and got me feeling
like a show stopper
Lookin' to the past
when I was young
Thinkin' 'bout the memories
I've come to love
Feelin' like a grape
turned into wine
and it will be okay
just give it time
give it time
I remember when my cousin
gave me his OG’s
Number 2 Air Jordans
it was back in ‘03
I was feeling like a king
but then he was like wait yo
Instead I’mma give you
all black retros
I was like That’s cool
I’mma wear them at school
I got my classroom buzzing
with the aah’s and the ooh’s
I had suede brush
and my rubberbands
to slang the hornets
at the suckas
who don’t understand
reprimand the dudes
who keep stepping
on your shoes
they don’t have a clue
why you waddle like a fool
cause we don’t wanna crease them
we don’t wanna crease them
I tell you
I felt like nobody was dope as me
I’m dressed so fresh so clean
but one day I was humbled
my world came crumbling down
my mama threw them out
Lookin' to the past
when I was young
Thinkin' 'bout the memories
I've come to love
Feelin' like a grape
turned into wine
and it will be okay
just give it time
