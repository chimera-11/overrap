Know no limits 
to feel the truth 
When the world stops spinnin 
I'll know it's you 
Searching all night 
like a spotlight 
For the one to show 
Could it be you 
could it be me 
Only way to know  
I'm all yours 
when you really want 
to take me there 
Don't let me go no where 
I'd give it all up for you I swear  
Only Freal luv 
That love that keeps me shaking 
So real there's no mistaking 
I’d give it all up to you I swear 
Only Freal luv 
Lovin that real luv 
something you feel luv 
Turning me back to the old me 
Ride for my realla 
I die for my realla 
I give you respect like the OGs 
Lockin me down like the police 
We ain't never be lonely 
Protectin’ my love 
like a goalie 
You'll be the only one 
next to me right with the homies 
We got that empire mind 
combine n’ steadily rise 
That be freal 
Moment of truth of has arrived 
trust that forever you ride 
That be freal 
You be the bank on my side 
you supervise 
Lets make a deal 
Let's get it sealed 
let's make a trill 
Let's rule the world 
together freal

Hustle to win

ain't no haters can
step to our grind
We got that empire mind
함께 천천히 올라
That be freal
진실이 닿는 순간
느껴봐 눈을 감아
That be freal
You be the bank on my side
nothing but dimes
Let’s make a deal
서서히 필 꿈과 현실
내 손을 잡으면
together freal
Freal luv
