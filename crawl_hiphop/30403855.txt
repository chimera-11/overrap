VERSE 1
Sometimes you gotta get away think and rearrange all the love and hidden pain that you have inside
When you’re full of pride you may never know how it goes you could die man at any given time so
Best to shine combine and keep your mind right you will find types that might agree with you
Choose to be with you although the sea is blue and cold your red soul warms the storms that form from the unknown 
<br>CHORUS
TIme Changed
For all the same
We can we do
<br>Refrain
And let’s believe
There’s something new 
<br>When will we be there?
After we get past Red October
Soon we will be there
The storms are moving fast but they’re not over so
<br>VERSE 2
Many will believe what they want to judge and haunt you equipped with the half truth and set 
In their ways every single day praise given but they living in a manner that models their own threats
Quiet as kept, perceptions hidden the love given over ridden with delusions of grandeur alone
Burned bridges but could we just heal the wound with stitches and brace for bad weather that forms from the unknown cause
<br>CHORUS
TIme Changed
For all the same
We can we do
<br>Refrain
And let’s believe
There’s something new 
<br>After we get past Red October
