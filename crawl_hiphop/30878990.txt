I’m the fxxking best last night 
Asian 스타일로 서로 인사해 she 
lay her head down 
Thought it was an earthquake 
Woo I made that bed rock 
니네 잠을 깨워 다 
벌금 내고 check out 
I pull my pants up 
채우러 가 내 가방 안 
이룰 때 까지는 페달 계속 밟아 난 
이룬다면 오랜지족처럼 cash out 
달라 많이 니네 오빠들과 
난 그릇 사이즈 
Sorry 니네 오빤 bankrupted 
Cowboi hit the jackpot 
걸어 내 전 재산 
Cowboi always stay fly 
Till i die like Mafias yeah 
못 믿겠음 버려 어제 메준 내 스카프

She said she want nobody but me 
She said i’m the best 
난 최고야 오늘밤도 
i’m the best you ever had 
늘 너의 곁에는 어울리지 않아 
너네 오빤 매일 
I’m tryna be your special 
Bxxch i feel like Johnny Dang 
네 눈을 보면 매일 
넌 어울리지 않아 너의 옆엔 
난 성공을 눈 앞에 둬 
넌 놓치면 후회 해 
You could be my friend 
넌 나에게 손을 내밀 땐 
이미 너무 늦은 뒤에야 
오늘밤은 너와 day n night 
하루 종일 벌어 나가 
너에게 줄 선물을 봐 
다른 놈은 감히 너에게 
뭐가 어울릴 줄 몰라 
너희 마음에 드는 옷을 골라 
너에겐 꿈일 뿐이야

This is best song you ever heard 
Finally came up 
you don't know what I been through 
갚을게 많어 무거운 맘의 빛도 
She loves my fashion style 
나의 몸도 
I was nothing 
But I made something 
I’m still thirsty 
너는 어때 
내가 전부 걸 때 
You just follow girl thing 
She said I’m the best ya 
Me and my team gon' cash out 
내가 살고있는 세상 
널 위해 키울게 ya 
내 친구들은 내 뒤를 봐줘 
날 기다릴 땐 위를 봐줘 
주변 어딜 둘러봐도 
나 같은 놈 단 하나도 
Ya That’s why I’m the best ya 
That’s why I run fast ya 
지금 너보다 비싼 
차와 목걸이 진짜 
찍어 올리지 insta 
You just wanna be a star 
I'm just shining like a star 
You the fxxking best 
Best I ever had 
You the fxxking best 
Best I ever had
