well fleet sand in our socks 
in our hair
girl your love feels like 
when my pops wasn't there
i don't mind i don't leave 
i don't stop i don't care
but when it breaks will my heart 
pay the ho spital fare 
i been
ten toes down thats in 
everything i do 
but what if
ten years in it ain't 
good enough for you 
and i don't
make no bread i don't 
get no major deal 
what if i
do and then i leave and i for 
get the way it feels 
to be this 
lonely to be this broke 
to be this hungry to be this dope
to me it's funny
i don't think i should be doing 
these shows for 200 a pop now
but i need the money
so long to the postman
pitbull ate my homework
sky fell and we both ran
both ran till our toes hurt
both hands on the dozier
12 xans you a poser
mow grass for exposure
both grasping for closure
toe tag for the culture
slow dance with a toaster
poach fans for the growth spurt
hold hands till it's over
dope brands yelling zoltan 
sniffing cocan off a poster
coast boys in this bitch now 
make a slow pan to the chauffeur 
i don't nothing for granted 
i really grew up on granite
i'm from a whole other planet
this here an ode for the seeds 
that I've sewed and i've planted
i'm older than ever 
i'm low but i manage
hoping the damage is 
all the way done 
seen some my friends 
that turned all the way numb
hoping they scope out 
they anger inside them & smoke it 
they don't then it's all they become
you wouldn't think its a game 
if you knew you'd already won
you wouldn't think 
you knew anything 
if you knew anything 
you would know everything 
you would pray hard to stay young
i learned it all from my bitch 
she put me on to the fact 
that I'm terribly selfish
she showed me love 
she gave me everything 
i render therapy helpless
twenty four years old 
get your shit together
you ain't shit you ain't grown 
get your shit together
you ain't never gonna blow 
get your shit together
she gon leave if you don't 
get your shit together
