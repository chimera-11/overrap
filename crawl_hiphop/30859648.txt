a touch a smile of you
them always work have me crazy
tryna get over you
it just don't work tell me why
you'd be floatin'
in my head my head
got me sinkin' into you
Empty my cup and mind
with all these feels and confusions
tellin' myself
that I don't care of you anymore
you'd be floatin' in my head my head
got me sinkin' into you
