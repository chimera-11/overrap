Feels like I'm all alone
got fake people in my zone
I'm sick and tired of 
these fake love everywhere I go
girls come at me for my money
they want the fame isn't it funny
When I'm with my girl 
I don't even feel like 
she trully loves me yeah
they left me jaded I felt depressed
lost a friend but now I feel blessed
what a stupid choice 
it's common sense
I'm better alone gotta take a breath
I'm living my life and 
I'm taking my time
and I don't give a damn 
about what's on your mind
no we ain't the same no
it's not the same road
we're not the same 
we don't have the same
we don't have the same Goal
I'm on a plane hoe
you're in the friend zone
my ex is a bitch hoe
I'm leaving you all
I'm leaving you all
this life is a game bro
I'm better off without you oh
you drag me down oh don't you oh
we're going seperate ways 
we're not in the same way
we're not in the we're not in the
we're not in the same game
I'm better off without you oh
you drag me down oh don't you oh
we're going seperate ways
그만 붙어 왜이래
we're not in the 우린 아냐
we're not in the same game
까놓고 말할게 너랑 그만할래
가사 쓸 생각은 없었는데 
BZ가 써달래
평소에 가사에 네 얘기 써달랬잖아 
자 여기 있어 이거 네 얘기야 
마음에 들기를 바라
Ay 뭐가 또 잔인해 
ay 뭐가 또 잔인해 
네가 더 잔인해
너 진짜로 그렇게 
그렇게 생각해 nah
참 뻔뻔하다 뻔데긴 줄 알았어
너 연기 쩐다 여배우를 찾았어
그럼 내가 나쁜 놈이 돼 줄게
이유가 궁금하면 대 줄게
나는 사실 너랑 하는 섹스보다 
노래를 만드는 게 
훨씬 더 기분 좋아 girl
I never thought you would've 
done this to me
너무 늦기 전에 알게 돼서 나 기쁘지
We don't have the same life 
don't you see
연락하지 마 BZ처럼 난 바쁘니
I'm better off without you oh
you drag me down oh don't you oh
we're going seperate ways
we're not in the same way
we're not in the we're not in the
we're not in the same game
I'm better off without you oh
you drag me down oh don't you oh
we're going seperate ways
그만 붙어 왜이래
we're not in the 우린 아냐

I'm getting stronger everytime
I live my life the way I want it and
no one will ever bring me down
I'm better off without you
