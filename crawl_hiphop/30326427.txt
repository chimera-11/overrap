Feel the pressure
yeah I feel the pressure
When I'm the one who speaks
in the voice of my ancestors
And the homies out
on Western are sayin’
they'll represent us
So I'm forever tatted
fuck a temporary henna
It's a privilege to pursue
my happiness cuz my crew
Got a list of things to do
before dreamin’
about their future
Running the family business
handlin’ father’s sickness
All the sacrifices given
I'm doing this all for you
It's a letter to my homies
you will never have to owe me
Buyin’ bottles
karaoke with a couple model tomes
Fuck the police
Cuffin’ you
your wrist will have a Rollie
Tryin’ to write a happy ending
to dis story
I guess dis is a goin’ away
letter
I ain't comin’ back to town
'till I'm doin’ like way better
Don't be offended
when phone calls go to voicemails
The flight attendant asked me
to turn it off that's real
I'm bringing gold to me city
who's with me
Gold watches for my people
did you miss me
Bought ‘em all off
the jeweler by the pound
A couple karats turn dis bitch
into 24K-Town
I'm bringing gold to me city
who's with me
Gold watches for my people
did you miss me
Bought ‘em all off
the jeweler by the pound
A couple karats turn dis bitch
into 24K-Town
Where'd you go
They askin’ me where I went
Gone for a couple months
but it feels like I barely left
Everybody is a statue dat froze
at their last step
Every weekend is a celebration
of the past-tense
My brothers with resolutions
My sisters with no excuses
I salute ya'
Let's go and make some moments
in the future
I ain't saying I'm Confucius
I'm confused as much as ya'll
Another student of life
I just studied abroad
Normally I'd be on Normandie
but normal is done
It ain't about repping inside
but outside where you're from
When they're drunk
they yell it from the top of
their lungs
But over drums
they'll hear it for generation
to come K-Town
I guess dis is a goin’ away
letter
I ain't comin’ back to town
'till I'm doing like way better
Don't be offended
when phone calls go to voicemail
The flight attendant asked me
to turn it off that's real
24K-Town
Bringing gold to my city
I'm bringing gold to me city
who's with me
Gold watches for my people
did you miss me
Bought them all off
the jeweler by the pound
A couple karats turn dis bitch
into 24K-Town
I'm bringing gold to me city
who's with me
Gold watches for my people
did you miss me
Bought them all off
the jeweler by the pound
A couple karats turn dis bitch
into 24K-Town
