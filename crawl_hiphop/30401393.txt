Let go 
Move on 
Just know it will be okaaaay 
Because 
Better days are on the waaaay and 
Better days are here to stay 
Let go 
Move on 
Just know it will be okaaaay 
Because 
Better days are on the waaaay and 
Better days are here to stay 
Yesterday is gone 
but I still feel it 
Past pain still on my face 
and I can't conceal it 
Way too many mistakes 
Trust that I may have misplaced 
Regrets that I can't shake 
Let's begin to heal it 
Put some ice in the glass 
and begin the session 
Put pen to the pad 
and begin confession 
I begin to question everything 
Learned I know nothing 
and that's ok 
Now begin the lessons 
Like Empty your cup 
learn to let go 
The devil has a name 
it's called your ego 
Let the voice inside you guide 
you to the truth 
Let truth and love 
become your credo 
These are lessons I learned 
from the past 
I walked through the inferno 
to find a better path 
And now I'm on fire ready to go 
Here's a toast a better day 
is here at long last 
Let go 
Move on 
Just know it will be okaaaay 
Because 
Better days are on the waaaay and 
Better days are here to stay 
Let go 
Move on 
Just know it will be okaaaay 
Because 
Better days are on the waaaay and 
Better days are here to stay 
Presently I'm feeling progressive 
Charged up and energized 
Building off of lessons 
I learned and ones I realized 
A better me is the mission 
Become my own competition 
until my ego and true self have  
synergized 
Not just my mind but my body too 
So I'm getting in shape 
and feeling like a new man 
I got a long way to go 
Yeah I know 
But I plan to stick with it 
for my life's span 
I wake up early 
and kiss my wife's hand 
Let her know 
that I'm here for her now 
and always 
Tell her even an angel might 
have a hard day 
But always know you're amazing 
to me in all ways 
I ain't no buddha 
but I'm better than before 
Cause I'm Looking at life 
with my eyes open 
No man is perfect 
and life ain't always easy but 
Better days are coming 
that's what I'm hoping 
Let go
Move on
Just know it will be okaaaay
Because
Better days are on the waaaay and
Better days are here to stay
Let go
Move on
Just know it will be okaaaay
Because
Better days are on the waaaay and
Better days are here to stay
In life we
ALL experience times of stress
We may think we have all
of the answers but
A wise man once told me
In order to grow we must LET GO
Let go of egos
and and simply say
I dont know And thats ok
And once we let go the answers
begin to pour in like water
in an empty glass
Sadness becomes silly
and withdrawl becomes will power
Life will shower you with love 
and better days are sure to come
Let go
Move on
Just know it will be okaaaay
Because
Better days are on the waaaay and
Better days are here to stay
Let go
Move on
Just know it will be okaaaay
Because
Better days are on the waaaay and
Better days are here to stay
Let go
Move on
Just know it will be okaaaay
Because
Better days are on the waaaay and
Better days are here to stay
Let go
Move on
Just know it will be okaaaay
Because
Better days are on the waaaay and
Better days are here to stay
