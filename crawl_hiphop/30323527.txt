하늘의 별과 달은 너와 날 의미해 
가만히 있어 
Girl give my all for you to shine
연락 오는 남자들도 많겠지만 
좋다는 고백도 수두룩 해
하지만 you Girl 나는 달라 
Smile on your face 
I'll take that everyday
Dance with you lady 
I get high all the way 
이 노래 듣고 너만 좋으면 돼 
밤마다 달 보면 날 찾게 돼
몸 풀 때 마다 생각 해야 돼 
Oh lady Don't you say no
Oh babe Don't you say no
Oh girl my feelings for you
아침에 눈 뜰 때 마다 생각나 
Oh lady Don't you say no 
Oh baby Don't you say no 
널 찾은걸 감사해 
널 조금씩 허락 해줘
