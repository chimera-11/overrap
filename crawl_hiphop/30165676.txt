You and I 
No one can tell me why 
Every time you look 
into my eyes 
I feel so alive 
This love i can't hide 
I need u so bad 
Give me more signs 
as well about 
you and I 
니가 뭐가 그래 그만해 
이젠 그만좀 동그랗게 
성격이 참 모가 나있어 
Oh think of you every day 
and night 
술 한잔 하며 털어내 
이젠 내게 기대 부탁해 
남자 사람 친구 역할 
항상 위로 해줄게 
I didn't know how much you 
feel about me 
but I'd make it clear 
I just wanna be your 
one and only 
be your girl 
I'll do everything 
that I could make 
my dream come real 
Oh baby we will be 
in love forever 
you and I 
아무 말도 없었던 
너와 나 
Even though 
조금 서툴렀지만 
난 알았어 
너의 마음 자랐어 
Don’t want to 
let you know 
don’t want to 
let you go 
Think about you 
Don’t let you know 
just want to give you 
my love more 
Think about you 
Don’t let you go 
just want to give you 
my love more
