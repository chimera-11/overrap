banging on my chest like
i'm king kong
got a big head vince vaughn
can't kill me better
bring your big guns
kushj from ethiopia we
light up africa like akon
camouflaged like viet congs
leather gloves gary payton
fresh off the boat like
eddie huang strip club
with a 100 ones
feeling like kobe
i'm bout to drop 81
my wife her name lady luck
feeling like
james bond saving these
hoes you should have a cape on
i'm on the low getting
my dough but i'm bout to
blow like napalm
we stay lit like london
bridge so fly
make the haters sick
so sly we should be
mi-6 no matter
where i still first draft pick
you ain't even on no
List you ain't got no bitch
i'm swtichin up styles
new money new clothes
and kicks watch
how i jump out the whip

Im feeling so fresh
out of saint laurent
내 적들은 모두 다 들어와
찌꺼기 랩퍼들
모두 다 저리가고
너네의 사장을 데려와
time to break dance and break 
necks pay me in cash or respect
you're obsolete like tape decks 
i'm the new guy like daniel craig
oops did i mention i'm asian a 
korean rapper that's aging
trying to escape from the 
basement of the society that 
never raised him
still rock a rolex i flex like 
a bowflex dipped in the latest
you cannot stop all my agents 
from breaking out of these cages
your stereo types not loud enough 
your stereo type not loud enough
imma keep doing just what i want 
i keep counting up a lot of wons
your stereo type not loud enough 
your stereo type not loud enough
this message will self destruct in
