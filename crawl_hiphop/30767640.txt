I feel like dead inside 
it may because i hanging 
with only the deads at night
You told me better get that 
trend fuck your ghetto style 
at first i'll get your nose job done
then your rapping starts 
You better not rhyming a lot 
dumb it down fucker 
You can't get both of 'em 
You a clown fucker 
Talk about life 
You better Hype
If you do that if you blew that pipe 
im gonna slice 
Read the vibe fucker 
What the hell is juice 
a drink you like
They said they love the culture 
they don't even know 
the birth of The Furious 5
They get the messege but um
who the Grandmaster flash
and im like Fuck your Thoughts 
respect the structure 
A constructor from the gutter 
A wake-up for your slumber
The Rhyme's been a crusher for bias
uncut 
i'mma comin' lumber jack with the axe
A soul survivor still feel like it
I ain't talking real bullshit 
I live like it 
You know the drama 
no one talks honest
I be on that shit talking issues 
imma piece of shit
Realer than a killer bullet 
from the window 
I be on that shit i be on that beat 
i be on that beat
You know the drama 
no one talks honest
I be on that shit talking issues 
imma piece of shit
realer than a killer bullet 
from the window 
I be on that shit i be on that beat 
i be on that beat
Yeah right 
im a piece of shit i lie
Even though my mama dying 
said me and dad'll be fine
Started rapping cause i wanted 
get dime on my line
Im obsessed with this 90's 
The Old School shine
Junior High Gangstarr
Drop high with the nas 
Wu-Tang Boogie down 
Back 2005

after that NWA 
They still banging 
Back from the arithmetic class and 
went to mama work place
then paint the whole queens 
2013 
mama had a cancer in her breast
Last june she passed 
don't ask me why im stressed 
I prayed 
i prayed i prayed i prayed 
for her chance 
Nothing lasts 
Started broke 
got rich and broke back
Fuck money she said 
Son 
don't be a coward study and 
study all that respect and 
power ain't a thing 
you got the hours 
You know the drama 
no one talks honest
I be on that shit talking issues 
imma piece of shit
Realer than a killer bullet 
from the window 
I be on that shit i be on that beat 
i be on that beat
You know the drama 
no one talks honest
I be on that shit talking issues 
imma piece of shit
realer than a killer bullet 
from the window 
I be on that shit i be on that beat

I be on that shit talking issues 
imma piece of shit
Realer than a killer bullet 
from the window 
I be on that shit i be on that beat

You know the drama 
no one talks honest
I be on that shit talking issues 
imma piece of shit
realer than a killer bullet 
from the window 
I be on that shit i be on that beat 
i be on that beat
