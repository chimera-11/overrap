Just what is it
that will bring you contentment
What will satisfy you King Midas
King Midas sighed
I wish that everything
I touch would turn to gold
Then I could be truly happy
Very well then
the stranger said
I will grant your wish
You shall have the golden touch
Use it wisely
King Midas
My vocabulary got the Midas touch
Here is something
you can't understand
The illest niggas
under my thumb is like putty
Aw yeah
That Midas touch with it
how it turn to gold
Well I don't really even have
to sweat money at all
Good as gold
like I got the motherfucking
Midas touch
You can call me Midas
see his reflection in my iris
Golden bias you couldn't
figure it with science
How I spit the brightest
golden bars lead to blindness
Respect Your Highness
'fore you get tossed to the lions
It's heavy armor Hennessy
and marijuana-fueled
The golden rule
Awon drop a lot of jewels
Au on the periodic table
Ready-made no associated labels
That realness 18k
that Old Egyptian
Weapon-quality is
my scientific description
The technician
my skin glisten with the flakes
No costume jewels
these fuck niggas are fake
I piss Ace shit nuggets
and bust rope nuts
My seeds are the golden fruit
Niggas can't cope
with the dope I release
Turned the beats
to the riches for the streets
Now feast nigga
My vocabulary got the Midas touch
Here is something
you can't understand
The illest niggas
under my thumb is like putty
Aw yeah
That Midas touch with it
how it turn to gold
Well I don't really even have
to sweat money at all
Good as gold
like I got the motherfucking
Midas touch
As a descendant of slaves
I can't see how a chain
put a nigga in graves
Fuck your shackles
I'm out for that Trinidad James
with a lasso
Coming with that lyrical pain
Ready to tackle this
motherfucking hip-hop game
Because these lames
stay soft as gelato
I'm cold as gazpacho
I cook like Gustavo
The color on the homicide scene
Coincide with this cream
getting capo
Y'all counterfeit
metal alloy and brass
Niggas laugh if you ever try
to pawn that for cash
My shine'll outlast your lifetime
I'm bringing back tight rhymes
'Bout night crimes
and niggas who slice dimes
24k in my veins
that's my lifeline
Awon golden bars equal that
Price Is Right sign
Make 'em rewind
wack niggas on the decline
In the meantime
your chick wanna get me behind
My vocabulary got the Midas touch
Here is something
you can't understand
The illest niggas
under my thumb is like putty
Aw yeah
That Midas touch with it
how it turn to gold
Well I don't really even have
to sweat money at all
Good as gold
like I got the motherfucking
Midas touch
