Imma don imma ride or die
하든 말든 어서 하나 말아봐
Mastermind 이건
100 미터 아닌 marathon
Sunrise 와이키키 바닷가
Forbidden push it to the limit
목격해 you about to witness
All in bet i handle business
Balling like russle simmons
미래 P. Diddy and the family
Im a Misfit no one understands me
Mars like bruno different planet
비상사태 nothing goes
as how you plan it
No smoke i become a im a asshole
save the last j for air port
thinjb more ammo
쌍권총 guns up like im rambo
Bankroll after bankroll
Ballin in my sandles take over
Book gang take your shit
and just take off
해적 하지만 안 해쳐
Rip hugh hefner
Lets Ride until i mutherfuckin die
Thats right see me
in my mutherfuckin eyes
쉬지 않는 서울에서
grinding like a shaved ice
Selling overseas 어디든지 at ease
Banned from the land
never liked that 12
색안경을 끼고
see everything same tone
폴로 입고 let me pop
Different color collar
Livin in a different Zone
나를 불러 Baller
