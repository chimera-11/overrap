didn't think a man like me 
could fall like this
what's been and what's been 
done how did it come to this
pleasing 
i was pleading for a case
don't nobody ever told me this
a fine line between right or wrong 
forgive me for my sins
you think i'm on to 
something baby
you see me in the 
morning going crazy
do we define the meaningless
or is it me tripping on illusions
who am i talking to
who am i talking to
who am i talking to
a reminiscence of 
what's left is you
who am i talking to
pleading for a minute 
seeing things existing 
who am i talking to
baby this ain't rocket science 
get it through you
maybe we can turn the clock 
counterclockwise 
set it to the moon
이기적인 척 하고싶어 
믿기 싫은 신을 원망하며 
남 탓하기 딱 좋은 날에 나 대 나 
술한잔을 눈물로 채워
and i know what it is 
what i not to do 
and i know what it is 
what i got to do 
but the mood really 
killing me nice 
and this moet really 
ain't helping my vibe
내가 원하는건 이거 
그렇다고 남는건 미련
이런지도 벌써 몇번 
셀수없이 오늘도 밤을 세워
기쁠땐 기뻐야해 
다 잃고 난 뒤에 
회상해봐야 뭐해
오늘도 니 생각에 취해야해 
이제 쯤이면 질릴텐데
왜 갈수록 삶은 더 흑백이돼
i lost my conscious 
being too cautious
around you got a little nauseous
but that was just the 
childish kid getting active
and you took it wrongly
어쩔수 없지 널 탓 하지 않지
i was a fool for believing in magic 
그 딴건 없지 
넌 너데로 걸어갔지
난 눈을 가린체 그대로 서 있지
그 시절 땜에 아직 
과거 속에 살어
그리움을 심고 난 기다려
you think i'm on to 
something baby
you see me in the 
morning going crazy
do we define the meaningless
or is it me tripping on illusions
who am i talking to
a reminiscence of 
what's left is you
who am i talking to
some say love is unconditional
but why's it like endless 
conditions and rules
picture perfect moments 
smeared when thoughts unfold
시간이 지날수록 
삼켜놨던 눈물은 
하염없이 밤새 쌓여
it's good for a time but like 
we know time is on the fly 
on it's own and we follow
and we follow 
started out as strangers
worked our way up 
that's the danger
calling each other babe 
on the phone with you all day
너 하나만 바라본 내게 
돌아온 건 하나 없네
affection and obsession 
flirting in between i'm stressing
and i'm confessing 
these sleepless nights are endless
imagine you in my presence 
forgetting 
who am i talking to
who am i talking to
who am i talking to
