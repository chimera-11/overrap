Pouring away all the dark
I can't find you 둘러뵈도 널
찾는건 어려워 (you're so hard to find)
찾는건 어려워 (you're so hard to find)
Pouring away all the dark
I can't find you 둘러뵈도 널
찾는건 어려워 (you're so hard to find)
찾는건 어려워 (you're so hard to find)
<br>Remember when I kept you in,
you told me all you had was this
Remember when I kept you in,
