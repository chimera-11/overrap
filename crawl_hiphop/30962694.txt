all these memories go deja vu 
repeating all over 
same days I knew
calling you every night 
oh don't tell me
it's dream no that's not true
girl I'm faded faded
blank right now I cannot go
I'm just waiting waiting
stuck by myself what can I do
girl pick up the phone 
please let me know
I'm gonna call everyone 
that I know
lookin' at the mirror 
where no one belongs
wishing you would answer 
I feel so alone
몇시간째인지 
I can't remember
been losing my mind 
well does it matter
이제 네게 난 예외 인듯해서
feelin' like you left me forever
You don't understand 
they disturbin' me yeh
I feel like the jealousy 
is tatted on me yeh
I got nothing's on my mind 
except you honestly yeh
I think I'm jealous 
I want you to let it all leave yeh
keep telling you I'm not done
this jealousy devours mind
they're just on the side-line
you was the one in my life
you know it ain't the same
everyday I live in pain
I just wanna see you right now
wanna see you right now
why u wanna see me down
why u wanna see me down
when every time I treat you right
every time I treat you right
fxxk all them bxxxxxs they lie
say something that's 
on your mind
girl please tell me 
that you were mine
please tell me 
that you were mine
you will never know 
how this feels inside me
all this jealousy keeps givin' me 
the pain I never been thru
I just wanna know the true 
you know the true you
why you gotta hide 
I thought I knew you 
I thought I knew you
all these memories go deja vu
repeating all over 
same days I knew
calling you everynight 
oh don't tell me
it's dream no that's not true
girl I'm faded faded
blank right now I cannot go
I'm just waiting waiting
stuck by myself what can I do
I know it's not right every time
memories crawling up 
my mind mind
I'm wishin' again 
I'm wishin' again
I just wanna go on with you
I know they come back 
every night
memories crawling up 
my mind right

I just wanna go on with you
all these memories 
go deja vu
repeating all over same 
days I knew
calling you every night 
oh don't tell me
it's dream no that's not true
girl I'm faded faded
blank right now I cannot go
I'm just waiting waiting
stuck by myself what can I do
all these memories 
go deja vu
calling you every night 
girl I'm faded faded
I'm just waiting waiting
