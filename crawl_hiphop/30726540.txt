Love 
That's what you got struck by 
i've been on love 
That's what you got me 
just moving like 
Love 
What i've been looking 
for that's was your love 
When i be work out 
your prayer starts
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby 
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby 
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby
Bed grappling
I don't talk too much like Chaplin
Now you know what i want
Just twerking 
Baby 단 둘이 하는 레슬링
If we get closer 
Hey babe i can be your plumber
깔끔하게 한 번 홀인원 
가끔 볼 일 없어 Amigo
리드미컬하게 같이 춤추듯이 OK
미끈미끈하게 자세하겐 설명 못 해 
Guess i'm crazy That's it baby 
Yes my baby 
Yes we're crazy That's it baby 
Yes my baby
Love 
That's what you got struck by 
i've been on love 
That's what you got me 
just moving like 
Love 
What i've been looking 
for that's was your love 
When i be work out 
your prayer starts
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby
Rock scissors paper Pure game 
Let's do with no question
Okay 자신있는 제스쳐 You lose
I'll be your master
높게 위로 올라간다거나 
멀리 떠날 수도 
Show me your passport
이해못한 눈치라면 그건 거짓말 
이 분위기에선
Alright goddamn 
너무 솔직했지 Maybe
좀 더 당길테니 Baby 
좀 더 밀어 봐봐 Lady
Alright 이 비슷비슷한 루트 
이미 서로 알지만 쉿
나도 싫진 않지만 Move 
식기 전에 우리의 Main dish
Love 
That's what you got struck by 
i've been on love 
That's what you got me 
just moving like 
Love 
What i've been looking 
for that's was your love 
When i be work out 
your prayer starts
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby 
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby 
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby
Guess i'm crazy That's my baby
