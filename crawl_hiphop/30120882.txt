I’m taking my totes 
I’m totally gone off the liquor 
I am on 
So baby come on 
Don’t play no games for my sake 
For my Sake 
My eyes can hardly see straight 
This high-grade 
Is making me nauseous 
Got a vendetta to vanquish 
Got a nigga now feeling so anxious 
So babygirl please no questions 
I’m trying to ease my tension 
While trying to keep my balance 
Feel like I been stuck in a limbo 
Between high and low 
and the stick is my ego 
Yea Yea yea know how that shit go 
Take a Take a 
Sip of this patron 
All the stressing 
and the depression 
Gon take a toll 
Don’t be a victim don’t be a victim 
See these fuckboys on a mission 
Don’t pay attention 
don’t pay attention 
Babygirl please don’t listen 
You want to chill and party 
Fuck around with ya 
homegirls get naughty 
I got I got shrooms and the molly 
Babygirl lets finish 
what we started 
You know 
Gotta live for ya self 
They gon judge either way 
and off no help 
You got a story to tell 
Make sure every page brings wealth 
She told me that this henny 
make her honest 
Drowning all her problems 
with this vodka 
She would trade off her soul 
For pills and the party 
The molly and the Verdi 
She like them pills and the party 
She loving that codeine 
She wanna do some liquor and drugs 
She wanna do some liquor and drugs 
She wanna do some liquor and drugs 
She wanna do some liquor nuh uh 
She wanna do some liquor nuh uh 
I look in the mirror to a stranger 
My mind drift off like ken block 
in a block charger 
Super charged up hitting corners 
I don’t wanna be the one to call her 
My pride and my bullshit 
Or whatever you call it 
My heart needs a coffin 
All this love shit is so haunting 
Its dead to me and I’m off it 
But she making me her target 
She’s cupid with a 12 gauge loaded 
Shotgun kisses I’m hoping 
when she reload it 
It makes her other lips open 
Im tryna get in yo garden 
You the eve of the modern day era 
Summertime imitates your presence 
A black god bringing me my heaven 
But look pause for a second
I know that power corrupts
I know you got too much
You been out of touch
with your old self
Went from a basic chick
to a bombshell
And you be so lit and blow so well Uh
I see the worth in the work
that you put in
I see the birth of a complex human
Could be worse you could
work and be losing
Im watching ya movements
With a pupil Ra and Horus
You know the gods of Egypt
Im the reason that recently
You need a decent guy
To go deep and relieve
The deepest cry
Took too many l’s in ya lifetime
But now im your lifeline
I came at the right time
She told me that this henny
make her honest
Drowning all her problems
with this vodka
She would trade off her soul
For pills and the party
The molly and the Verdi
She like them pills and the party
She loving that codeine
She wanna do some liquor and drugs
She wanna do some liquor and drugs
She wanna do some liquor and drugs
She wanna do some liquor nuh uh
She wanna do some liquor nuh uh
She wanna do some liquor and drugs
She wanna do some liquor and drugs
