Youngest dreams
Smoking on the microphones fiend
Got jeans and a dollar screaming
CREAM Stack greens
Wet dreams of Maxim models
make'em get creamed
Shame on their skin
poor Henn over crime scene
Stay kin to name Big
represent by the weed
Be hakim with extreme at present
to the scheming reprimander
Know it's got double edge effect
to your agenda
a trouble if i got the sander
Our struggle nothing similar
pretender
it's offend to telling me
surrender
panda may they never
be my mentor
Rhyme vendor A tremendous line
bodies diggas 'fore november
walk a lantern you know
he don't fuck around thotties
Born treachin' naughty
friends be hardy
rapper's kind guardy
Find asian soundbombing
bombarding harming is my hobby
Yo when i done carving
names to narcotics
'Fore that i ain't quit
I ain't stop I ain't bitch out
I ain't sell shit
The seoul survivor
know that i ain't quit
I ain't stop I ain't bitch out
I ain't sell shit
The seoul survivor
Dead broke
You know streets shit's cold
Son of pitchfork
i'mma bound to that gold
Chain where the Tombstone lay
Graves to welcome diggas
Half your ears to the speaker
the guitar's vigor
other half to concrete
Freaks know i'm sicker
Speaker speak up
as i getting bigger weaker
they get
I get lit-er No filter
Tell twitter
Consider me as ghost
undead but butter soft
the turn of underdog
It's the finest one
from down south of fucking seoul
Got box of raw roughing emcees
If you please i'm gon stop
but crew gon feast hold your bars
at least
Want beef
then you bring your shiv
sleep under jesus piece
hope that stop me being
Resurrectin' all these deads
as my mac lit I reflect it
Burn your flags gonna infected
i'mma die with the classic
'Fore that i ain't quit
I ain't stop I ain't bitch out
I ain't sell shit
The seoul survivor
know that i ain't quit
I ain't stop I ain't bitch out
I ain't sell shit
The seoul survivor
'Fore that i ain't quit
I ain't stop I ain't bitch out
I ain't sell shit
The seoul survivor
know that i ain't quit
I ain't stop I ain't bitch out
I ain't sell shit
The seoul survivor
