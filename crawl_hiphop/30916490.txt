pop that 4 5 pills 
no feelings 
and u fuck thoses peoples 
didn't even know 
when you trippy
pop that varume in your mouth
than heavy high
APRO IS DIFFERENT
실없이 웃고 연기는 
위로 새어나가
pull up in da club then 
she gone mad
hold your prada
when she was young 
surrounded by mystery
mystery
to me she just girl 
who born in wrong place
there's no rhythm in your blues
demoiselle demoiselle
if i die befo' i wake
옆자리엔 누가 나를 위해 
서있지 can't even guess
니가 욕을 뱉을땐 고약해
근데 고요히 가라앉을땐 늘
pop that pills 널 위해
vivid red lip locked
babe you let your mark on me
mark on me
vivid red lip locked
babe you let your mark on me
mark on me
blue red magenta
i know you been hurt by
love i can feel that
blue red magenta
i know you been hurt by
love i can feel that yeah
in the poor side
아버지는 허리띠를 내려쳤지 목에
내가 아닌 형제들을 때릴때면 
that's the worst part 
zoom in
그땔 보려면 6번의 신고를 
하룻밤에 했던
기록이 필요 
i put my head on the pillow 
벗어나길 바랬지
너도 다름아닌 삶을 살았다며 
유별나 주목을 받지
언어는 유연하고 목은 뻣뻣해 
like parkins
in the project 
love is just playin'
두고 말어 니 허벅지를 
더듬게 하지
힐튼 호텔 위에서도 
새우잠을 잘 수도
연기로 허기를 채우진 못해
took your prozac 
mo' unprotected
plan B 를 준비해 vet detective
손마디가 타들어갈때까지 피워
진료기록안에 비워둘 자리는 
미리 비워
pointless mind 
Bourbon with your blue blurr
and u know it's better than 
nothin' i know you hurt
in the poor side 
니 아버진 내렸지 발목에 걸려있던 
underpants 
god damn 
vivid red lip locked
babe you let your mark on me 
mark on me
vivid red lip locked
babe you let your mark on me
mark on me
can't believe it
such a fairy tales
your love is untamable
can't believe it
such a bitter shit to bite
your blue your bleed
but i can see your true colors inside
your love is out of bound
your love is out of bound
your love is out of bound
your love is out of bound
