I've been thru battles 
but never love is the cause
I put my heart on a trigger 
down to my flaws
They here to play me 
then try to kiss me tomorrow 
And leave me defeated 
before they send me to war
I'm down to battle like 
everything is at cost
Till I run outta ammo and 
all my freedom is lost
you can’t be trusted 
when all your fingers are crossed 
Settin it off 
now yall settin me off
Send me to war send me to war 
love and defeat me and then you 
send me to war 
Send me to war send me to war 
love and defeat me and then you 
send me to war 
Send me to war send me to war 
love and defeat me and then you 
send me to war 
Send me to war send me to war 
love and defeat me and then you 
send me to war 
send me to war
cold hearted to the Purple Hearts
war zone to a work of art 
i learned the hard way 
finessed a parlay 
your life and mine are 
now worlds apart
bless my enemies 
and broken bonds 
some are dead to me 
and some are fallen 
built and wrecked it 
like the berlin wall
fucked up what we had to 
fuck up commas 
aint no forever shit 
call me a pessimist 
i seen them look 
in your face and smile 
while killing you softly 
they make it look effortless 
brother to enemy 
lover to memory 
just remember what comes after dark 
losing my family 
curse of the kennedys 
with my niece a new chapter starts 
look at the scars 
yes look at the squad yes yes
less than we started with
dearly departed to 
posse of all yes men 
all is fair in love and war 
i don’t think you want a war 
goin hard and overboard
die for the squad 
lets go to war 
Send me to war send me to war 
love and defeat me and then you 
send me to war 
Send me to war send me to war 
love and defeat me and then you 
send me to war 
send me to war 
I've been thru battles 
but never love is the cause
I put my heart on a trigger 
down to my flaws
They here to play me 
then try to kiss me tomorrow 
And leave me defeated 
before they send me to war
I'm down to battle like 
everything is at cost
Till I run outta ammo and 
all my freedom is lost
you can’t be trusted 
when all your fingers are crossed 
Settin it off 
now yall settin me off
Send me to war send me to war 
love and defeat me and then you 
send me to war 
Send me to war send me to war 
love and defeat me and then you 
send me to war 
Send me to war send me to war
love and defeat me and then you 
send me to war 
Send me to war send me to war
love and defeat me and then you 
send me to war 
send me to war
