every day i'm thinkin`
bout the love
thinkin` what i got
매일같이 내가 만든
bass위에 올라타
풍경이 조금 변해도
내 길은 똑같아
Now i'm on the way success
on the way to love
내 손 끝에는 항상
별이 반짝이네
눈 속에 담을거야
오직 나를 위해
누군가 내 노래를
기다린다면 난
잠들지 못 할걸
널 웃게 하기 전 까지
Dreams my wheels
drinkin` evey night bottle wine
every summer tour at all the town
and all the ladies by my side
내가 꿈꾸는 모든 게
내 두손이 닿을 수 있게
네가 날 기다렸다면
난 오직 너를 위해
밤새워 노랠 쓸 거고
넌 그냥 즐기면 돼
I'm still workin` and hustle
and grindin`
what i used to be yeah
fallin` fallin`
tonight i know
fallin` fallin`
sunrise sundown yeah
Sometimes i fallin` down
look up in the sky
thinkin` bout my pride
They tryna hold me down
i ain't never
can't nobody take my pride
If no one is around me yeah
if no one is around me
if no one is around me yeah
I know why i do it
just do it for better me
Gettin' money like a dog
spendin` like a hustler
Thinkin' bout the peace
livin' like a soldier
All of my success
i'll swing it like a dancer
handler painter builder jeweler
Pocket full of wish
so how could i sleep
every single day is precious
so how could i leave
어쩌면 내가 좀 더
멋진 사람이었다면
네가 날 떠나지
않았을까 abandon
Now doin` all for my self
hooked on my plan
Thinkin` bout money
i'll get it racks on my name
I'm looking for a real love
yeah i'm gonna say is trill love
날 웃게 하는 노랠
만들거야 내 두 손으로
Do it for my flying
i`ve been waiting for so long
I've never doubt it of my passion
I've never doubt it of my ambition
Yes i'm mean it babe yeah
fallin` fallin`
tonight i know
fallin` fallin`
sunrise sundown yeah
Sometimes i fallin` down
look up in the sky
thinkin` bout my pride
They tryna hold me down
i ain't never
can't nobody take my pride
If no one is around me yeah
if no one is around me
if no one is around me yeah
I know why i do it
just do it for better me
Do it for better me yeah
If on one is around me
I know why i do it just
do it for better me
do it for better me
