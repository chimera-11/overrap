이젠 보여주려 하진 않아
내 potential
아는 사람은 알겠지
이걸 들으면
수줍은 모습으로
가사를 써서 들려주던
풋내기가 얼마나
변했는지 말야
How Are you go hard man
너에겐 더이상
보이질 않아 미래
이렇다 저렇다
너에게 얘길 듣던 시절엔
답이라 믿고 살아왔는데
이젠 깨달았네 fuck u wack
Where you at my respect
없어 이젠 보낼 clap
네가 없으니
계속 올라가 나의 어깨
No one can`t stop my way
keep drivin still grindin yeah
듣기나 해 내 맘대로
판 한번 짜볼테니
We be them motherfucking
Madbulls Like
Come fuck with us
cause we`re so cool Like
We be them motherfucking
Madbulls Shit
Come fuck with us
we got the Juice
Young nigga in a masquerade
Drippin blood on a blank page
In the mud in the middle
of bunch of dreaded thugs
bout to raise cain
Please believe me
My flow is wheezy
I spit cough
and don't eat often
cause niggas cheezy
On lock like my best investment
Bout to switch
to my second weapon
Y'all quick to
just give impressions
Pullin tricks stead
of gettin lessons
Best part is y'all think
it's authentic
Now the kid
who you least expected
Comin with that organic flow
That tofu kit
from wholefoods wit
The occational anecdote
Spit nutritional antidote
It's that talk your grandma spoke
With the twang
of them southern folk
We be them motherfucking
Madbulls Like
Come fuck with us
cause we`re so cool Like
We be them motherfucking
Madbulls Shit
Come fuck with us
we got the Juice
