I'm a Hip-Hop Angel
You obey me unconditionally
Here is the rap
I'm a Hip-Hop Angel
You obey me unconditionally
Here is the rap
My name is born today 
My name is bones
I'm a hip-hop angel
I'll give you a heavenly rap
All the words 
I spit are like God to you
Listen Listen Listen
All truth in the world 
comes out of my mouth
and you follow my words
I have piercing eyes
and you just carved a piercing
The truth is always one 
but you do not know
Now listen to me and follow me
You do not know 
you do not
I'll tell you all the truth
All you have to do is just believe me
I'm a hip-hop angel
In fact 
the highest angel of the angels
Who am I
It's me God of hip-hop

You obey me unconditionally
