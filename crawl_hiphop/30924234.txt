makin a hit since ninety and five 
우리 둘 모이면 마치 camp fire 
뜨거워 너무 뜨거워 so hot 
여기는 불가마 마치 꽃방 
중력을 무시해 feel in so fly 
when i am puffin up dope 
with cigar 
넥타이들은 일찍 귀가 
마치 cinderella but at a 5 
i make it snow 
눈 내려 준비해 엄마의 umbrella 
시험이 싫어서 시럽을 마셨어 
sippin on lean 
일하기 싫어서 감기에 걸렸어 
damn im so sick 
High as a mother fuckin kite aite 
But look im rockin 
like a rock star bling 
See Who knew 
i will get this Far shwoo 
See you know im not 
bout a clout no doub 
아무도 몰라  i had a sight see 
아무도 못봐  put it in work work 
아무도 몰라도 die hard uhh 
아마도 그녀는 알아서 like 
put it in work 
put it in work 
like a berzerk 
like a berzerk 
put it in work 
put it in work 
like a berzerk 
like a berzerk 
you can not forget
