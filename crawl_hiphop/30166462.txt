Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Because I got no break 
I go I pop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Because I got no break 
I go I pop
Presidential power 
with me I kick with'em
You can't stop me 
because I'm just feelin'em
Back from the 
death with the death-path
You can't killin'em
난 절대 용서 못해 
내게 피해 입히는
난 내가 만든걸 죽여 
내가 만든 건 죽여
내가 만든걸 즐겨 
내가 뜨면 숨 죽여
모르면 더 느껴 
알수록 더 느껴
과녁 향해 겨눠 
무서우면 기어 누워
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Because I got no break 
I go I pop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Because I got no break 
I go I pop
Look at me 
Pay attention
Music ain't shit 
I'm talkin' about fashion
Waxed up my jeans 
it's a balenciaga
TIght like your bitch 
She's gonna lose tension
Curse curse me out 
I'm just playin' with ya'll
목이 아프겠지 
그게 나의 위치야
고장 난 기차 
멈출 수 없는 수치야
속도는 최대로 
그녀는 또 미쳐 
그 앤 내 밑이야
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Because I got no break 
I go I pop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Because I got no break 
I go I pop
Margiela Maison Martin
Calf-Hair like Dalmatians
Everytime I go mobbin'
I pop it like a champagne
이건 아냐 캠페인
But they got me gettin' paid
Tellin' you the secrets to gain
Money is worth the pain
I be on that airplane 
Go high like a jumpman
다 그렇지 처음엔 
익숙해져 뭘 겁내
I don't know how to stop 
Got no break
I don't wanna stop 
so brave
준비 해 내 Trophy
결승선이 코 앞에
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Because I got no break 
I go I pop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Teach me how to stop
Because I got no break 
I go I pop
