triumphing over them by the Cross
triumphing over them by the Cross
When I return in triumph
I will tear down this tower
excelling in honor excelling
in power
my enemy does not triumph over me
I will look in triumph
on my enemies
in the end he will look
in triumph on his foes
Yes Jesus is the boss
in the end he will look
in triumph on his foes
Yes Jesus is the boss
you will do great things
and surely triumph
you will do great things
and surely triumph
triumphing over them by the Cross
triumphing over them by the Cross
Can you drink the cup I drink
You will drink the cup I drink
Be baptized with the baptism

Yes u will
Can you drink the cup I drink
You will drink the cup I drink
Be baptized with the baptism
I am baptized with
Yes u will
Father 4 give them 4
they do not know
what they are doing
You do not know
When that time will come
Father 4 give them 4
they do not know
what they are doing
You do not know
When that time will come
you will do great things
and surely triumph
you will do great things
and surely triumph
in the end he will look
in triumph on his foes
Yes Jesus is the boss
in the end he will look
in triumph on his foes
Yes Jesus is the boss
triumphing over them by the cross
triumphing over them by the cross
triumphing over them by the cross
triumphing over them by the cross
triumphing over them by the cross
