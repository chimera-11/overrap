i wake up
in motherfuckin nightmare
many many friends of mine
doesn't even damn care
well im fine
but what the fuck is this feelings
a crappy day guessing
hope ma premonition misses
umm 불안해 뭔가 재수 없는 사건이
들이 닥칠 것만 같아
뭐든 해야만 겠어 i gotta be
so i called ma fashion
best of friend of mine
dooseo got the answer
he was always been ma 해결사
oopsy doopsy
not answering his phone call
ring ring ring i gotta go
and ask myself bro
i'ma man of wishes always miss
the time we pissin'
im just popping this cocking
feelings to satisfy me peace in
wanna have some chillings ye
rat-ta-ta melody
compromise me dance me
a self-a-get a energy
my name is trilla well
you don't even realize
knock knock knock im home man
please open this
ring ring ring

it's TRILL again
he's been a best bro
never call me a dog
before i get overdose
doing insane thing
all this night
i rap before
cause of you my pinky dream
cause a be the blue dream
이딴 걸로 찾고 그럴 때마다
너가 내 악몽이네
딱딱한 내 멘탈을 깨
나한테 왜 이래 fuck it away
헛소리 상담 코너는 저쪽이야
대기표 끊어 back to the way
damn okay 얘기해봐
what's the matter
im not a babysitter
but i'll be your damn chilla
이미 지나가버린 시간들은
돌이 킬려 하지마
face the fact
두서 없이 가 ma friend
well you have to focus
on every moment
두서 없이 DOOSEO
sayin' ratta-ta melody
죽기라도 할 것 같애
죽일 생각부터 해
걱정 마 저 쌔깐한 여자나 낚아와
im a walking fuckin' rebel dog
and parafucks know that
sitting on tight and watch a
goddamn legendary move i made it
가사와 같은 삶을 살 거야
그 모든 걸 내가 쓸래
i don't fuck with superstition
i'll just fuckin walk ma own way
랩을 내 뱉을래
we XIPHOP the great era
rebel are babbling
the bad days i don't give a
im a bombshell killer
soon to be overachiever
mind is winner
my killers looking awesome
as damn fuck
then again
start recalling my memories
back to the nightmare
i dreamed about screaming
my death-end
전부 다는 통제 못 해
그러니 싹 다 내비둘래
have to know that
one day we all be an ashes
or the trashes
bitch
