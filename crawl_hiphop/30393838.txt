Woab
I never seen this before
Your eyes widened
They're never done that before
Gazed into my eye as entered the door
Yes I know were good friends
But our hearts has grown bolder
I'm a tell the truth
I will not lie
Days go dim
But your the crame of my eye
I don't know If we'll make it
Out of 168 hours per week
55's at work
For 47 hours were dead to the earth
Out of 66
33 is all hurt
For the other half
we don't want to talk
That was worst case scenario
But what about the best
chins held high
with our heads intact
Chests poked out
And our shoulders thrown back
Dancing
Duetting
Head turning
Woah
Give a good head bob if it is working
Dancing like two fools and
Why the fuck are we still
Hiding in the neon lights
Broken bottles at our feet
we Jumping to a beat that
We can’t even hear
Slip away in the dark
nobody watching
Taxi cab we know where this is going
We’ll do whatever you like
Crazy spell of desire
Is all that this may be
No thinking ‘till the sunlight
Whether it’s wrong or right
Can’t get it off my mind
I wish I could tell you
Things won’t change
I wish I wish
It’s that something
Spark into a flame
I know you want it
‘Cos I feel the same
Can’t control it
Noting to explain
‘Cos it’s that one thing
it’s that one thing
It’s that something
Spark into a flame
I know you want it
‘Cos I feel the same
I Can’t control it
Chemistry is off the chain
‘Cos it’s that one thing
It’s that something
If she keeps smiling
Imma give her that lumber
Lord have mercy
I pray to be stronger
Sitting in silence
While the night grows longer
wating for that perfect song
confidence at home Dang
Act now or theses room for regret
Don’t kiss too long
Or my minds on Sex
I want to see
Where this goes to next
Either it’s gone in a sec
Or were at home in a sec
Pipe up my mind
You better grow some stones
Her eyebrows are on Fleek
If I want too long
Imma be a Big Baby
Photoshoot Fresh
Sideways peace sign
screaming Kimchi Baby
Hanryu Nay
StarCraft Crazy
Done playing game
Let me know when your Ready
Surprising Rich home
You and I are alone
Yes I’m grateful were close
And to bargain seems wrong
