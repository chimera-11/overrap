You better understand
Yeah I’ve been working all day

Money who can hate it
So let's turn on the light
Better know yeah
You better know bitch
I want some mo’
You better know bitch
I want some mo’
You better know bitch

You better know bitch
I want some mo’
난 쉬고 싶지 않고 원해
더 많은 것을 비싼 차 돈 명예
여자와 도시 속 고급빌딩 그 높은
옥상 위에서 매주 벌어지는 Party
So I wake up in the morning
날 부르고 있어 돈이
누구처럼 멍청하게 살기엔
부족하잖아 시간이
땜에 늘어지지 않지
아침부터 새벽까지
Keep makin’ my song
When I’m in the zone
Don’t look at my phone
집중해 놀지 않고
가사대로 지켜야지 내 가족도
You better know 더 바쁘게 일하지
죽어 관에 들어가기 전
관둘 리는 없으니까 늘 성실히
How u feelin' How u feelin’
I’m at the 서초 반포대로 28길
작업이 끝난 뒤엔 Chillin’
Young Cream & DBC를 찾는다면
Hit me up
