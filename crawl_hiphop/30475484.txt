I'm here to stay none ah dem

I'm here to stay none ah dem

So me lace up me shoes
Head for tomorrow

Got to make it Got to brake it

Make it to Zion yo dats my goal
On the Ruff side on the Bad side

I'm here to stay none ah dem
can't get me out
일천구백칠십사년 729 갑오년
범띠에 시작된 드렁큰 타이거JK
나의 발걸음
어슬렁대는 허슬러
내 걸음걸이는 어슬렁
힘든 이들을 거드는
고독한 자와 떠드는
멋쩍은 미소 뒤 씁쓸한
나의 과거도 지난날의 추억
지금의 나를 만든 불빛의 어둠들
치고받고 싸웠던 지난날에 쌓였던
아픔을 억누르지 못해 헤매
헤매였던 날 깨달았지 서른 즈음
힘든 이들을 거두는
고독한 자와 떠드는
영웅은 멀지 않거든 나
You can’t get me down yeah
I'm here to stay none ah dem
can't get me down
I'm here to stay none ah dem
can't get me out
I'm here to stay none ah dem
can't get me down
I'm here to stay none ah dem
can't get me out
