Don't know why I just fell for you 
Don't know how I'd let you go
Don't know why I can't stay with you 
Don't know how you'd let me go
Yeah yeah 
girl you want me to take the risk 
to wast away our friendship
But the things on my mind deeply 
I wanna say it I'm confused 
between love and friendship 
what to keep 
Cause you capture my heart 
like throwing thorns on my face
I wanna dedicate myself to you 
but not easily 
I see the love in your eyes 
wanna make me to fly
I wanna to give you my smile 
my love would you take it 
Baby tell me the true 
everything will be cool
Your love so stronger 
we can live forever 
See how we used to dance flow 
in the garden making tea 
watching movies in the sun
Now everything changing 
fast like com-million 
You can be my one and only 
the one in a million
How long we gonna hold on 
to this until we wait no more 
let the love and friendship 
go slow sure sweet baby 
hold me closer never let me to go
I wanna cherish you and 
Don't know why 
keep not to love you and leave you
I just fell for you 
Don't know how I'd let you go
Don't know why I can't stay with you 
Don't know how you'd let me go
Why you gotta leave me

So I wonder why u ever gave a damn
Hold it down baby please hold it down

Baby where u at though

Why why why 
Don't you know I'm letting go
Cause I want to love you forever 
cause I want to have you forever
Please don't be sad 
If you keep me in your heart forever
Don't know why 
Don't know why I just fell for you 
Don't know how I'd let you go
Don't know why I can't stay with you 
Don't know how you'd let me go
Don't know why I just fell for you 
Don't know how 
I can live without you
