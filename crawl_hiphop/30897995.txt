눈 감으면 어제처럼 선명한 네 기억
손 닿을 듯한 목소리
우리라고 부르던 너와 나
아니 하나라고 믿었었던 너
So Let me go Say you done
whenever say you want to be
Why you weren’t Let me go
Say U done Whenever
Say you want to be
Why you weren’t Let me go
Say U done Whenever
Say you want to be
I know you wanted to leave me
So Take your burdens
on my shoulder
And leave
