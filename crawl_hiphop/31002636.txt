Diamonds shine when the lights out
Haters imitate my lifestyle
Where's your work
check the car fax
I'm on that bitch lips like Carmex
Diamonds shine when the lights out
Haters imitate my lifestyle
Where's your work
check the car fax
I'm on that bitch lips like Carmex
Smokin' out of bows
You can't count it all
Brought your hoes out
Didn't even have to call
She a freak hoe
hit me at 4 in the morn'
Gettin' smarter
with them addys on
Kickin' other pills
I don't know what is real
Literally
But can't deny that's how I feel
내게 절대 없지 이걸 멈추는 일
네가 사는 법 예의를 갖추는 길
For real though Like Star Trek
난 외계인 교신을 원하면 연락해
난 무서운 일들을 매일 해
상상 못 할 곳에 있네
My life's a movie like matinee
PayPal is my mailman
Diamonds shine
when the lights out
Haters imitate my lifestyle
Where's your
work check the car fax
I'm on that bitch lips like Carmex
Diamonds shine when the lights out
Haters imitate my lifestyle
Where's your work
check the car fax
I'm on that bitch lips like Carmex
They told me I can't do it
With them cookies I blew it
I swear to God I really knew it
With them Death Path I blew it
I'm savage on blackjack
Issa newish
Ya'll claimed to be artist
But you ain't shit
너희는 장식 난 깨지지 않는 공식
이 좁은 시야와 내가 보는 차이
이 높은 자리와 또
그 바닥과의 차이
나는 느끼지 괴리 어색해져 괜히
종근당 My steady
Got me doin' somethin' scary
순식간 매일이 시간이 빨라 왜이리
You got me goin' crazy
Bitch Don't you play me
Diamonds shine when the lights out
Haters imitate my lifestyle
Where's your work
check the car fax
I'm on that bitch lips like Carmex
Diamonds shine when the lights out
