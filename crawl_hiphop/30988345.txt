All I need is the rhythm of your 
heart beat
with a little bit of your melody
sing it to me like 
LA LA LA LA LA LA
cause All I need 
is the rhythm of your heart beat
with a little bit of your energy
give it it to me like 
LA LA LA LA LA LA
이른 아침 출근했어 
in the 스튜디오
let the 음악 carry on 
내 귀에 꼽은 이어폰
오늘 뭔가 될 거 같아 
좋은 기분이 들어
뜨거워진 microphone 
내 히트곡을 만들어
바빠서 놓친 문자 
맘에 담아 두지 말어
지금부터 퇴근까지 아마 한시간 
끝나고 바로 찾아 갈게 
나 늦어서 미안 
120 on the highway
너와 단둘이 차 타고 drive 
my hand on your thighs 
잠시 핸들을 놔 팔 뻗고 ride
다음 데이트 코스 내비 
지도에다 찍고 let the 음악 carry on 
tell me where we going C'mon 
Jessi 
I know you like what you see
왜 머뭇거리는지 
Oh right away 내게 와도 돼
there's nothing better 
All I need is the rhythm of your 
heart beat
with a little bit of your melody
sing it to me like 
LA LA LA LA LA LA
cause All I need 
is the rhythm of your heart beat
with a little bit of your energy
give it it to me like 
LA LA LA LA LA LA
Inspired by your curves 
got me writing in cursive
let the beat drop 
cuz all I can do 
is picture you twerkin'
mommy drop it 
low low like the 808 
shake it with the shakers 
keep it on the loop aye 
let the music take us
옆자리 DJ spin the playlist
맴도는 멜로디 내 귀에 붙은 riff
도시에서 멀리 벗어나고 day trip
바다 or Vegas 아무데나 name it
몸 가는 대로 we ain’t got no plans 
so lets go with the flow 
춤춰 on the go
붕떠 top down
지붕 위에 떠있어 흔들리는 머릿 결
내가 그 어디에 있던 
baby would you be there
Would you come back for me 
Would you be there for me 
Oh baby
내가 무너져도 손을 내밀어줘 
my baby
can you give it up for me 
Cause there's nothing better
All I need is the rhythm of your 
heart beat
with a little bit of your melody
sing it to me like 
LA LA LA LA LA LA
cause All I need 
is the rhythm of your 
heart beat
with a little bit of your energy
give it it to me like 
LA LA LA LA LA LA
All I need is the rhythm of your 
heart beat
with a little bit of your melody
sing it to me like 
LA LA LA LA LA LA
cause All I need 
is the rhythm of your heart beat
with a little bit of your energy it 
give it to me like 
LA LA LA LA 
All I need is the rhythm of your 
heart beat

sing it to me like 
LA LA LA LA LA LA

with a little bit of your energy
give it to me like 
LA LA LA LA LA LA
